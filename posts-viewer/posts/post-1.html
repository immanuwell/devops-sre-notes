<p>All important database concepts 👇</p>
<p>In modern DB systems you must master sharding, partitioning, and
replication. Sharding distributes data across separate nodes (horizontal
scale) by a carefully chosen shard-key so you don’t hit a single
bottleneck</p>
<p>Partitioning keeps data inside a single instance but splits it (by
date, range, hash) so queries touch fewer rows–improving local
performance</p>
<p>Replication gives you redundancy and more read throughput (and
sometimes geo-local reads) but you must manage consistency/latency
trade-offs</p>
<p>Tips: ✦ Pick your shard key once, early: changing it later means
massive re-sharding or hotspots.</p>
<p>✦ Combine partitioning within each shard so intra-shard queries stay
efficient (e.g., range-partition by timestamp inside a shard).</p>
<p>✦ In replication: route reads to followers but invalidate and refresh
cache on master writes so stale reads don’t bite you.</p>
<p>✦ Use a consistent-hashing ring (or proxy) so when you add/remove
shards you avoid remapping almost all keys</p>
<p>✦ Monitor shard load: if one shard gets 10× traffic of another you
get imbalance, fix it by re-splitting hot shard or choosing a different
key.</p>
<p>✦ Think cross-shard transactions: if your workload touches multiple
shards often, you’ll pay more latency + complexity — maybe favour
partitioning or fewer shards.</p>
